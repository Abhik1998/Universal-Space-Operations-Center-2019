# USOC - Universal Space Operation Center

This is a universal ground station that can be used to communicate via the Iridium satellite network as well as communicating to a scientific experiment using the computers serial port. 

The original version of this software was used as part of the [MIRKA2-RX experiment](http://www.ksat-stuttgart.de/en/projects/mirka2-rx) that was part of the [REXUS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rexus_and_Bexus) sounding rocket program. It is currently further developed as part of GSOC2017 so expect a lot of changes in the upcoming months :).
